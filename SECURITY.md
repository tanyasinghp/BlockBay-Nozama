# Security Guidelines for People Who Prefer Systems Not Exploding

Security is like plumbing. If you ignore it long enough, something bursts and everyone regrets it. To keep BlockBay-Nozama in working condition, we ask contributors and researchers to follow these guidelines:

Reporting:

* If you find a vulnerability, report it privately. Do not post it publicly like a trophy.
* Use the issue tracker only after we've patched the problem.
* Provide steps to reproduce. If we can't reproduce it, we can't fix it.
* Be patient. Maintainers are humans with day jobs and an unreasonable love for clean code.

What we care about:

* Smart contract vulnerabilities.
* Wallet or key handling issues.
* Authentication and identity problems.
* Anything that risks user funds, data, or the integrity of transactions.

What we don't care about:

* Typos.
* Theoretical vulnerabilities that require control of the moon's gravitational field.
* Style preferences disguised as security reports.

We appreciate responsible disclosure. If you find something serious, you'll earn eternal gratitude and possibly a mention in the Hall of Contributors.
