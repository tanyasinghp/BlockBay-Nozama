# Community Expectations for Humans With Keyboards

This project survives on cooperation, curiosity, and the ability to disagree without turning the room into a bonfire. If you're here, you're part of a community that cares about decentralized tech, open code, and building things that don't collapse under the weight of one company's whims.

What we expect:

* Treat contributors like actual people. They are.
* Argue about ideas. Don't argue about identity.
* If someone is wrong, show them the right way with code, not insults.
* Keep discussions technical, focused, and constructive. Philosophical tangents allowed only if they lead to commits.
* No gatekeeping. If someone wants to learn, help them learn.

What we don't expect:

* Personal attacks, harassment, or anything you'd be embarrassed to explain to your grandmother.
* Spam, noise, or low-effort contributions that look like they were typed during a power outage.
* Hidden agendas. This is an open source project, not a corporate boardroom.

If you break the rules, expect a gentle nudge first. If that doesn't work, expect less gentle nudges. If that still doesn't work, expect removal. No drama required.

This project exists because people collaborate. Help keep it that way.
