A roadmap is a promise, not a prophecy. Here's what we aim to build, assuming contributors don't vanish into the void and the coffee doesn't run out.

Phase 1: Core Functionality

* Listing and purchasing items using decentralized transactions.
* Wallet integration that doesn't make users cry.
* Basic seller pages and item details.
* Smart contract backbone for trustless commerce.

Phase 2: Reputation and Trust

* On-chain reputation system that can't be gamed by sock puppets.
* Dispute resolution that doesn't involve verbal combat.
* Verified seller badges.

Phase 3: Logistics Layer

* Integration with shipping partners.
* Delivery verification using on-chain proofs.
* Optional decentralized courier network modules.

Phase 4: Governance

* DAO structure for community decisions.
* Tokenized participation that encourages contribution rather than speculation.
* Modular voting on features and policy changes.

Phase 5: Expansion

* Multi-chain support.
* Plugin ecosystem for third-party extensions.
* Developer tools and APIs for storefront integrations.

If something here changes, evolves, or mutates, that's normal. Open source never goes exactly as planned, but it tends to go somewhere interesting.
